# Named-Pipe-Communication
This was project in my undergraduate Operating Systems course.  It is a communication method using a 'named pipe' in UNIX with a reader and writer (separate programs).

Part 1 is the Writer, and Part 2 is the Reader.  Have both of them running in separate command prompt windows, and begin typing and entering messages in the Writer to have the contents loaded into a buffer and unloaded/read into the Reader window seamlessly.
